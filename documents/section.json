  "content": "---\ndescription: |\n   A Section represents a configurable UI element for a deco.cx site.\n---\n\nSections are **UI components built with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)** that\ncan receive props configured by users on _deco.cx_'s Admin. The Section local\nimplementations live on the `sections/` folder in the Site's code, but it's also\npossible to [Install Apps](https://deco.cx/docs/en/getting-started/installing-an-app).\n\nSome examples of Sections for an ecommerce store would be:\n\n- **ProductShelf.tsx:** displays a product shelf with image, title and price.\n- **Header.tsx:** displays the standard header of the store, containing logo,\n  menu categories and links for cart and login.\n- **Banner.tsx:** displays image, text and some _Call to action_ for campaign or\n  specific department.\n\n## Interactivity\n\nNote that Sections run on the **server-side only**, so state and lifecycle such\nas `useState`, `useEffect` and callbacks such as `onClick`, `onInput` will not\nwork. In order for those to work, you'll need to use\n[interactive Islands](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/islands)\n\nIn _deco.cx_'s Admin, it's possible to interact with Sections in two places:\n\n- **Library:** Allows developers to configure the properties of Sections and\n  automatically see the generated UI. (Works similar to\n  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/))\n- **Pages:** Allows Section to be added to Page on the site, also being\n  configurable.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [Tutorial: Coding a new Section](https://deco.cx/docs/en/developing-guide/hello-world)\n- [Developing: Editable sections](https://deco.cx/docs/en/developing-guide/editable-sections)\n"
