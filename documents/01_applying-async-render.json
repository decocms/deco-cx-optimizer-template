  "content": "## 🧩 Async Rendering of an Entire Section via CMS\n\nAsync Render is a way to implement lazy loading for a section. The Lazy section (website/sections/Rendering/Lazy.tsx) is responsible for implementing the mechanism\nthat prevents the section from being rendered on the server and makes a request to the server for the section. If the section exports a component called `LoadingFallback`, it will be rendered\nby Lazy on the server, which is useful for displaying spinners or small parts of the section.\n\n### When to use it?\n\nIdeal for sections that are **below the fold**.\n\n> NOTE: If you have access to a tool for navigating pages, NAVIGATE and identify which sections are below the fold.\n\n### Step by Step\n\nEdit the CMS page content, composing the Lazy section with the section that already exists on the page.\n\n#### Before (without async render):\n\n```json\n// page json with CMS Content\n{\n  \"sections\": [\n    { \"__resolveType\": \"...\", // component props }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### After (with async render):\n\n```json\n{\n// page json with CMS Content\n  \"sections\": [\n    {\n      \"__resolveType\": \"website/sections/Rendering/Lazy.tsx\",\n      \"section\": {\n        \"__resolveType\": \"...\",\n        // component props\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> NOTE: It's possible to create and export a LoadingFallback component in the section, which will be rendered while the section component (default function) is loading.\n\n"
