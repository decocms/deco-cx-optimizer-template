  "description": "Guide for validating async render caching effectiveness and blocking problematic querystrings to improve cache hit rates.",
  "content": "## Checking if Async Render is properly cached\n\nEvery section rendered through Async Render or useSection makes a request in the browser to `/deco/render?<query parameters>`. For a good UX, the server response needs to contain the cache-control header with a time greater than `0`, to enable CDN and browser caching, ensuring that the section rendering response is fast and provides a good user experience.\n\nThe cache-control request header: `cache-control: max-age=60 (or any value different from zero) ...other values`.\n\n## Blocking querystrings in async render to improve cache hit rate\n\nThe async render request has some values that influence the cache key, which are the `props` and the `href`. The `href` is the address of the page that made the request. One of the problems is query strings from third-party services and analytics that don't influence the site's state. To improve the cache hit rate of sections, remove unnecessary querystrings that go in the href.\n\n- List the query strings that are affecting the async render;\n- Add the list in an array in the /blockedQs.ts file and export the array;\n- Import the querystrings from the /blockedQs.ts file, in the /apps/site.ts file, and pass it as an argument to the unstable_blockUseSectionHrefQueryStrings function that is imported from the \"@deco/deco/hooks\" package\n"
