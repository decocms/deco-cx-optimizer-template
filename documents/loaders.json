There are some tips on how to\n> optimize their usage. Here are some tips:\n>\n> 1. When the loader is reused in different sections or pages, it is recommended\n>    to use a saved loader (reusable)\n> 2. Sections that load data and are not displayed on the initial screen (above\n>    the fold) can be deferred\n\n## Reusing Loaders\n\nThe system's `sections` can have data loaded via `loaders`. These loaders can be\ndefined within the section itself or loaded from saved entities.\n\nThese saved entities can be created from loader blocks.\n\n![Creating a loader](https://github.com/deco-sites/starting/assets/882438/47c63784-4839-4d97-aff4-8c1e8e18332a)\n\nWhen saving a loader, it is guaranteed to be reusable in different sections. In\naddition to allowing props to be changed and reflected in all places where this\nloader is used, using this saved loader allows for optimizing the system's\nusage.\n\nDuring a page like the Product Description Page (PDP), it is necessary to load\ninformation about the product twice: once for SEO details loading and once for\ndisplaying the product itself. By using the same loader, Deco optimizes it so\nthat the loader is executed only once during the page rendering cycle.\n\n![image](https://github.com/deco-sites/starting/assets/882438/a39e3806-89e4-4b22-a179-491c048b18f7)\n\n## Deferred Section\n\n![image](https://github.com/deco-sites/starting/assets/882438/06b0fde3-874f-4b26-84b5-d4a41c94e5de)\n"
